# CloudFormation Workshop

Materials for the Tech Women Infrastructure as Code workshop held in London on the 30th Jan 2018.
 
## System Requirements

* [git] v2.14.1 or greater
* [awscli] v0.9.3 or greater
* [python] v2.6.5 or greater

These must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```
git --version
aws --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or [mac/linux][mac-path].

You'll also need an AWS account. Here are details of the [AWS Free Tier][aws-free-tier] .
